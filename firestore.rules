/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset is configured for an open testing environment.
 * Any signed-in user can read all data and write their own data. This is NOT
 * suitable for production but is ideal for development and testing, as it

 * allows easy data inspection and manipulation.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized hierarchically. A top-level 'distributors'
 * collection holds individual distributor profiles. All related data, such as
 * 'performanceMetrics', is stored in subcollections under the corresponding
 * distributor's document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions for Testing:
 * - Open Read Access: All authenticated users can read all documents in the
 *   'distributors' collection and their subcollections.
 * - User-Owned Writes: A user can only create, update, or delete data that
 *   corresponds to their own authentication UID. This prevents users from
 *   modifying each other's data while still allowing broad read access.
 * - Admin Override: A designated admin user has full write access to all distributor data.
 * - Default Deny: Any path not explicitly defined in these rules is inaccessible.
